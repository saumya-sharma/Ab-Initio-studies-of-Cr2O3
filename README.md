# Ab-Initio-studies-of-Cr2O3
Poster of the work presented at the MMM 2022 Conference, Minneapolis

A systematic ab initio strategy for assessing the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction(U) is being used, where the Hubbard U value is calculated through Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) using the Linear response
theory for Chromia (Cr2O3)
